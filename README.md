# RLPedia
RLPedia is a revolutionised way to make remote learning easy. It uses a opinianted AI model which runs in the servers keeping track of the users performance. Based on the performance, the model will chose the difficulty of the questions and update the learning curve. This strips most of the choices available to the user while making the learning path pretty straight forward and optimised.
